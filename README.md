# Flutter-BMI-Calculator-App-using-GetX
Create a simple and efficient BMI Calculator app using Flutter with the GetX state management library. The app allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index by providing their weight, height and age. The UI is intuitive and user-friendly, demonstrating the power of GetX for state management and navigation.


# Features:
# BMI Calculator Screen:

Input fields for entering gender,weight, height and age.
I used GestureDetector for gender input, Slider for height and I used Inkwel for weight and age
Calculate button triggers BMI calculation.
Result Dialogue displays the calculated BMI and corresponding health status (e.g., underweight, Healthy weight, overweight).
Attractive UI with smooth transitions.

# GetX State Management:

Utilize GetX controllers for managing state across the app.
Separate controllers for handling BMI calculation logic and navigation.
Navigation:


# Responsive Design:

Ensure a responsive UI that works well on different screen sizes.
Implementation Timeline:

Day 1:
Set up a new Flutter project.
Integrate GetX into the project.
Create the Home screen with basic UI.
Implement navigation to the BMI Calculator screen.
Design the BMI Calculator screen with input fields and result display.
Implement BMI calculation logic using GetX controllers.
Add smooth transitions and animations.
Note: This project is intentionally designed as a one-day project to focus on the core principles of GetX and keep the scope manageable. It serves as a quick demonstration of how GetX can simplify state management and navigation in a Flutter application.

Feel free to customize the features and design according to your preferences. This project aims to provide a starting point for understanding the integration of GetX into a Flutter app within a short timeframe.
